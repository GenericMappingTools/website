About
=====

GMT is an open-source collection of command-line tools for manipulating geographic and
Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and
producing high-quality illustrations ranging from simple x–y plots via contour maps to
artificially illuminated surfaces and 3D perspective views. It supports many map
projections and transformations and includes supporting data such as coastlines, rivers,
and political boundaries and optionally country polygons.


Council
-------

As of August 2016, GMT development and maintenance is being guided by a GMT Steering
Committee, led by Chair David Sandwell (Scripps) and members Dave Caress (MBARI),
Steve Diggs (Scripps), Dan Bassett (GNS Science, New Zealand), and Khalid Soofi (ConocoPhillips).


Support
-------

GMT could not have been designed without the generous support of several people:

* The founders (Wessel and Smith) gratefully acknowledge A. B. Watts and the late W. F.
  Haxby for supporting their efforts on the original version 1.0 while they were their
  graduate students at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
* Doug Shearer and Roger Davis patiently answered many questions over e-mail.
* The subroutine ``gauss`` was written and supplied by Bill Menke.

Further development was made possible by grants and fellowships:

* National Science Foundation grants

* Versions 2.0–2.1 would not have been possible without the support from the HIGP/SOEST
  Post-Doctoral Fellowship program to Paul Wessel.
* Walter H. F. Smith gratefully acknowledges the generous support of the C. H. and I. M.
  Green Foundation for Earth Sciences at the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary
  Physics, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California at San Diego.

History
-------

The GMT system was initiated in late 1987 at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia
University by graduate students Paul Wessel and Walter H. F. Smith.  Version 1 was
officially introduced to Lamont scientists in July 1988.  GMT 1 migrated by word of
mouth (and tape) to other institutions in the United States, UK, Japan, and France and
attracted a small following.  Paul took a Post-doctoral position at SOEST in December
1989 and continued the GMT development. Version 2.0 was released with an article in EOS,
October 1991, and quickly spread worldwide. Version 3.0 in 1993 which was released with
another article in EOS on August 15, 1995.  A major upgrade to GMT 4.0 took place in Oct
2004. Finally, in 2013 we released the new GMT 5 series, which are generally
backwards compatible with GMT 4 syntax. Another major upgrade took place in 2019 with
the release of GMT 6 and modern mode.  GMT is used by tens of thousands of users
worldwide in a broad range of disciplines.
