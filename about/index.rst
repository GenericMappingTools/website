About
=====

GMT is an open-source collection of command-line tools for manipulating geographic and
Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and
producing PostScript_ illustrations ranging from simple xâ€“y plots via contour maps to
artificially illuminated surfaces and 3D perspective views. It supports many map
projections and transformations and includes supporting data such as coastlines, rivers,
and political boundaries and optionally country polygons.

Development on GitHub and we have a CoC.
