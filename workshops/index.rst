2020-06-21 | Making Maps and Movies [CANCELLED]
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* **Title:** Making Maps and Movies with the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)
* **Instructors:** Paul Wessel, TBD
* **When:** June 21 (Sunday), 2020. 8:30 am - 5:00 pm
* **Where:** University of Hawaii at Manoa, HI, USA
* **Repository:** TBD
* **URL:** https://goldschmidt.info/2020/eventTypeView?type=354#event2018000175

The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) is widely used in the geosciences to make graphs, maps and animations.
This one-day workshop introduces participants to GMT 6 modern mode and how data manipulation and
plotting of points, lines, polygons, text, and grids are accomplished via GMT scripting. We will run
GMT scripts from the command line in a bash terminal under Linux, macOS, or Windows; familiarity with
a UNIX shell will be helpful but not required. We will also introduce participants to the making of
basic animations using GMT. No prior experience with GMT is required. Attendees must bring laptops
with pre-installed software to the workshop – instructions will be provided before the conference.

2019-12-08 | GMT Developer Workshop at AGU2019
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* **Title:** Become a Generic Mapping Tools Contributor Even If You Can't Code
* **Instructors:** Paul Wessel, Joaquim Luis, Leonardo Uieda, Dongdong Tian, Xiaohua Xu
* **When:**  Sunday, 08 December 2019 08:00 am -12:20 pm (PST)
* **Where:** AGU 2019 Fall Meeting | Moscone Convention Center, San Francisco, CA, USA
* **Website:** https://www.agu.org/Events/SCIWS4-Generic-Mapping-Tools

We will teach you how to join the GMT developer community and make contributions to the
project EVEN IF YOU CAN’T CODE. This workshop will provide hands-on experience: we will
guide you through setting up your computer, building GMT, writing documentation, and
using git and GitHub to work on GMT development in a friendly and collaborative
environment.

2019-11-12 | PyGMT Workshop at FOSS4G Oceania 2019
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* **Title:** PyGMT for geoscientists - A PyData compatible package for analyzing and plotting time-series and gridded data
* **Instructors:** Wei Ji Leong
* **When:** Tuesday Nov 12, 13:30 - 17:00 (NZDT)
* **Where:** Rutherford House 205, Pipitea Campus, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand
* **Website:** https://2019.foss4g-oceania.org/schedule/2019-11-12?sessionId=SPGUQV
* **Repository:** https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/foss4g2019oceania

This hands-on workshop covers the use of PyGMT to analyze geospatial data and produce
publication quality figures and animations in an interactive Jupyter lab environment.
There will also be a free Community Day code sprint on 2019-11-15 where everyone is
invited to join and contribute into making PyGMT even better!
