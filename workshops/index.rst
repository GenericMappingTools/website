* **EGU Session info:** https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/session/43186
* **Application Portal:** https://egu22.eu/register_and_venue/registration.html

This short course is geared towards geoscientists interested in creating beautiful maps using Python.
Only basic Python knowledge is needed, and a background in cartography is not required to use PyGMT effectively!
The 1.5 hour long short course will be based on content adapted from https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/2021-unavco-course
and https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/foss4g2019oceania. The session will consist of a 10 minute
introduction followed by four 20 minute sessions, each of which will include demonstrations using
interactive Jupyter notebooks. Participants will be able to follow along with the demonstration using
online computing environments, and there will be a separate opportunity to engage with the other
participants and short course instructors.

We expressly welcome students and geoscientists working on any geo related fields
(e.g. Earth Observation, Geophysical, Marine, Magnetic, Gravity, Planetary, etc) to join.
Come and find out what PyGMT can do to level up your geoprocessing workflow!

GMT scripts from the command line in a bash terminal under Linux, macOS, or Windows; familiarity with
a UNIX shell will be helpful but not required. We will also introduce participants to the making of
basic animations using GMT. No prior experience with GMT is required. Attendees must bring laptops
with pre-installed software to the workshop – instructions will be provided before the conference.
