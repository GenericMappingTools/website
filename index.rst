GMT is an open source collection of about 80 command-line tools for manipulating
geographic and Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend fitting, gridding,
projecting, etc.) and producing PostScript illustrations ranging from simple xâ€“y plots
via contour maps to artificially illuminated surfaces and 3D perspective views; the GMT
supplements add another 40 more specialized and discipline-specific tools. GMT supports
over 30 map projections and transformations and requires support data such as GSHHG
coastlines, rivers, and political boundaries and optionally DCW country polygons. GMT is
developed and maintained by Paul Wessel, Walter H. F. Smith, Remko Scharroo, Joaquim
Luis and Florian Wobbe, with help from a global set of volunteers, and is supported by
the National Science Foundation. It is released under the GNU Lesser General Public
License version 3 or any later version.
