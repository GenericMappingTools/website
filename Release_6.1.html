GMT 6.1 ChangeLog

Apart from bug fixes and general improvements across GMT, here are specifics
on new features provided in 6.1.  Note: Some are only available in modern mode.

General changes:
    Updated and tiled remote data sets: Earth relief, masks, day/night imagery
    Add MVT (Mapbox Vector Tile) as another GDAL URL dataset
    Let gmt.history, gmt.conf, and gmt.cpt be hierarchical and separate for panels and figures in modern mode
    Use list of keywords instead of bit-sum for MAP_ANNOT_OBLIQUE
    Let the macOS bundle be built with OpenMP
    Let GMT recognize MATLAB headers/comments via multiple IO_HEADER_MARKER characters
    Let a signed grid cross size mean centered or asymmetrical grid ticks
    Add modifier +v for a vertical oblique Equator in -JO
    New -B modifier +i for internal frame annotations
    New -B modifier +f to turn on fancy geographic annotations
    New polar projection modifiers and capabilities
    Revise verbosity default levels and their names and abbreviations
    Add Web-Mercator as new sphere selection
    Explore adding long-format GMT options
    Allow both -i and -o to specify an open-ended list of columns to end of record
    API improvements to support GMT/MATLAB, pyGMT, and GMT.jl environments
    Several new high-resolution movies now moved to new YouTube GMT Collection

New Common Options:
    -l: Add auto legend entries from plot, plot3d, *contour in modern mode
    -q: Select specific input or output data rows

New Modules:

    batch: Automate batch job processing
    grdmix: Blending and transforming grids and images
    grdinterpolate: Interpolate 2-D grids or 1-D series from a 3-D data cube
    grdgdal: Execute GDAL raster programs from GMT

New Core Module Features:

    gmtspatial: -Sb computes buffers around lines (via optional GEOS library)
    sample1d: Adds smoothing cubic spline via -Fs, with optional weights (-W)
    gmtget: Options -D, -I, -N, -Q handle remote data set download and query
    begin: Ignore user gmt.conf files normally included via -C
    gmtregress: Let -A limit angles considered for LMS regression
    grdconvert: Enable scaling/translation services with -Z
    gmtvector: Add vector translate operator via -Tt
    grdinfo: Now -C also appends registration
    grdmath: New operators DAYNIGHT, BLEND, DOT, RGB2HSV, HSV2RGB
    gmtmath: New operators RGB2HSV, HSV2RGB
    grdfilter: Allow filter width units m|s. Let filter width be a grid with variable widths
    grdcontour: Better handling of contour file with unique angles and pens per contour 
    pscontour: Better handling of contour file with unique angles and pens per contour 
    grdtrack: Determine peak in crossections with -F; let -E+c continue track if next line is a continuation of previous 
    movie: Add -E for optional title sequence, -K for fade in and fade out, -Sb for PostScript layer, -P for progress indicators
    surface: Let  -D take a modifier +z to set a constant breakline level
    grdfill: Implement minimum-curvature spline infill with -Ac
    grdgradient: Add support ambient light in -N, as in -E
    grd2kml: New option -W for contour overlays

Supplement updates:
    seis: Update modules' syntax and make their i/o more robust
    potential: grdflexure adds new transfer functions now documented with equations
